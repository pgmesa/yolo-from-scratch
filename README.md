# YOLO from Scratch

This repository contains YOLO functionality implemented from scratch or adapted from the original source, with comprehensive documentation. Its primary goal is to provide an accessible resource for understanding YOLO concepts in depth.

For the moment, the project comprises three main components:

- `loss.py`: This file contains a cleaned and fully documented implementation of the YOLOv5 and YOLOv3 loss functions, as detailed in the associated Medium article.
- `loss_analysis.ipynb`: It includes an analysis of the Ultralytics YOLOv5 loss source code, as described in the Medium article, along with a comparison to the implementations in `loss.py`.
- `ultralytics_tools`: This directory holds unchanged functionalities sourced from the Ultralytics YOLO repositories.
